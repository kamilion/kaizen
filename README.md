===============

This is a web framework based on the 'flask' python web microframework.

http://flask.pocoo.org/

It's currently based on top of Flask-Classy.

https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Classy/

We expect the RethinkDB Database version 2.X or above to be installed.

http://www.rethinkdb.com/

The RethinkDB Python driver is also required.

This system is based on many modules. 

It comes as an example website which can be customized to your use-case.

You might be interested in the Tickets module.

Or perhaps the Pages module, which is a minimal CMS.

Maybe you might be interested in our Auth module, which uses SCRYPT to store passwords.

Modules are enabled and disabled in /app/__init__.py

Configuration is kept in /app/config.py

There are some test views in /testviews that may be of minor interest to see how things are set up.
